- convertor between WGS 84 and Projection de Mercator (both ways)
- import shapefile file -> return the content (the department and their points)
- import DCENT temperatures files -> idk do something with it
- import CSV files (if there's any) -> return the data in it (dictionnary ?)

- draw each department using polygon from fltk -> blank map of France/departments (the sea departments are on the sides like a regular France map -> calculations needed)
- draw the values and data things where they need to be (WGS 84 coordinates) with the right size
